1. Pass shaders as an object with an index, where the index is the order in which to run the shaders
2. Pass uniforms and "layers" as objects with a corresponding index
3. Build "Pseudolayers" -> objects that can be input into the webgl object and render without further manipulation
   These will be a way of storing "layers" that can easily be generated on the fly as and when needed
4. Finish and test _runMultipleSources method of webgl object
