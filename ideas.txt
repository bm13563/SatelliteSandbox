long term ideas dump

- visualise wms in 3d using band values (for visualising DEMs)
- pre-train ML models that output kernels/ functions and write these into aerial
- export/ import pseudolayer as JSON -> allows json of a pseudolayer to be c + p'd then sent to someone else,
  who can apply the exact same processing by importing the pseudolayer
- processing history of pseudolayer -> allows user to see the exact processing steps that were taken to get to 
  the pseudolayer
- export canvas image (as georeferenced tif??)
- vectorise canvas -> export features as geojson? this would be huge as would allow use of OL's vector processing
- allow users to write their own shaders and submit them
